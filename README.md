This is a playground for your first steps in testing, so instead of installing it from NPM it is recommended to clone it from repo instead.

Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mykhailiuk-chanel/cucumber-cypress.git

```

Step 2: Install dependencies via npm:

```bash
npm i
```

This will install cypress & cucmber deps

Step 3: Run tests:

```bash
npm run cypress:run-features
```

You can find all features files in the _cypress/integration/features/_ folder and create a new ones.
